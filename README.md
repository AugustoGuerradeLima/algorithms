This is a repository for my studies. This repository contains fundamental items such as basic algorithms, college resolutions and programming challenges.

<h2>Algorithms</h2>
This folder contains some C implementations for the algorithms presented in CLRS. In addition to Java Script implementations from the Khan Academy course. The presented algorithms are basic and serve for my learning.

<h2>College</h2>
This folder contains exercises, studies and college classes, covering a greater number of fundamental areas.

<h2>Challenges</h2>
Some challenges that I found interesting and are now here.
