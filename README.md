<h1>Algorithms</h1>
<p>
This repository intends to store an immensity of algorithms studied and written during the time by me.
The algorithms folder stores the most famous algorithms that you are likely to study in any computer course.
The high school folder stores some of the code I used in high school for classes and preparing for tests.

<h1>About C</h1>
About the C programming language, I believe it is a gateway to other languages, the C language can seem challenging at times, building algorithms in it at times can be really boring. But once learned, C can make you learn anything else.
C is also used a lot in college, basically all the lists you find here will be in C like.
It is possible to find some codes in JS or another language, they may be from courses or something different that I was testing around.
